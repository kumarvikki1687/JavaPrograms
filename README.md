JDK :
Java Development Kit
It is used to develop and run java applications
It includes JRE, a compiler, an interpreter and some more tools used to develop java applications.

JRE:
Java Runtime Environment
When we are done with developing our java applications, we need an environment to run it.
JRE provides that environment.
It includes JVM, core classes and supporting files.

JVM:
When JRE runs any java programs, it goes to JVM where it reads the code line-by-line.
Hence it is also called interpreter.
